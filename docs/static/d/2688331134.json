This is a free course to learn how to use and fit GAMs using <strong>mgcv</strong> package in R, design GAM models to fit your data science problems, and understand, visualize, and predict from the results.  GAMs offer offer a middle ground between simple linear models and complex machine-learning techniques, allowing you to model and understand complex systems.</p><p>This is a free, open source course originally created for a commerical platform.
